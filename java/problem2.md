# Building a Microservices-Based E-commerce Application

## Task: Develop a microservices-based e-commerce application using Spring Boot.

### Details:

1. **Service Decomposition:** Break down the application into multiple microservices such as Product Service, Order Service, User Service, and Payment Service.

2. **Service Communication:** Use REST APIs for communication between microservices. Implement service discovery using Eureka and load balancing with Ribbon.

3. **API Gateway:** Set up an API Gateway using Spring Cloud Gateway to route requests to the appropriate microservice.

4. **Database Integration:** Each microservice should have its own database. Use Spring Data JPA for database operations.

5. **Security:** Implement authentication and authorization using Spring Security and JWT. Ensure secure communication between microservices.

6. **Resilience:** Implement resilience patterns like Circuit Breaker using Resilience4j to handle failures gracefully.

7. **Monitoring:** Use Spring Boot Actuator and Prometheus for monitoring the health and performance of the microservices. Visualize metrics using Grafana.

8. **Testing:** Write unit tests and integration tests for each microservice. Use Test containers for testing with real databases.

9. **You can put ideas to improve the project's outstanding:**
