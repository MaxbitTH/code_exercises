# Implementing Circuit Breaker Pattern

## Task: Implement the circuit breaker pattern in a microservices architecture using Spring Boot.

### Details:

1. **Set Up Microservices:** Create two microservices, Service A and Service B. Service A will call an endpoint in Service B.

2. **Service Communication:** Use REST APIs for communication between Service A and Service B.

3. **Add Resilience4j:** Integrate Resilience4j into Service A to implement the circuit breaker pattern.

4. **Configure Circuit Breaker:**

   - Define the circuit breaker configuration (e.g., failure rate threshold, wait duration).
   - Implement fallback methods to handle failures gracefully.

5. **Simulate Failures:** Introduce failures in Service B (e.g., by throwing exceptions) to test the circuit breaker functionality.

6. **Monitoring:** Use Spring Boot Actuator to monitor the state of the circuit breaker.

7. **You can put ideas to improve the project's outstanding:**
